				<h1>What is NASA?</h1>
				<p>
					NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National
					Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), to give the U.S.
					space development effort a distinctly civilian orientation,
					emphasizing peaceful applications in space science.[4][5][6]
					NASA has since led most American space exploration,
					including Project Mercury, Project Gemini, the 1968â€“1972
					Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and
					the Space Shuttle.
				</p>
				<p>
					NASA supports the International Space Station and oversees
					the development of the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch
					System for the crewed lunar Artemis program, Commercial Crew
					spacecraft, and the planned Lunar Gateway space station. The
					agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program,
					which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown
					management for uncrewed NASA launches.
				</p>
				<p>
					NASA's science is focused on better understanding Earth
					through the Earth Observing System advancing heliophysics
					through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's
					Heliophysics Research Program exploring bodies throughout
